# Visually-Impaired-Assistance
Its a web application which I built during a hackathon in Nepal. This application helps the visually impaired student to study. The way it works is: Visually impaired students  puts a request on that particular application. Other people who can see gets a notification and reads those books for them and makes a audio book.
